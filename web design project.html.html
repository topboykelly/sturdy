        <h1 align="center">My Website</h1>
        <p>This weekend was more about hosting a domain, which was an assignment.</p>  
        <br>To start, Hosting a domain can be quite an adventure.
        <br>I remeber when I first hosted my own domain.
        <br>It started with choosing the perfect name that represented my vision.
        <br>After some brainstorming, <br>i found one that just felt right.
        <h2 align="center">More</h2>
        <br>Next i selected a hosting provider that had good reviews and seemed reliable. <br>The setup process was straightforward, <br>and within a short time, my website was live. <br>It was thrilling to see my ideas come to life on the internet.
